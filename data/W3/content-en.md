# Week 3 ｜Gender expression 

## Expression as Performance

Gender expression is the way we communicate our gender to the world through external signals.

- External Presentation: Unlike identity (who you are), expression is what you show—through clothing, hairstyle, posture, and speech .
- Social Construction: What counts as "masculine" or "feminine" is not biological; it is shaped by cultural norms, media, and social reinforcement .
- The Genderbread Model: Expression is an independent component, distinct from identity, sex, or orientation .

### From David Bowie’s glam rock style to Lin Yu-Ting’s powerful presence, how do these figures challenge the "standard script" of gender ?


  - Have you ever felt a "spark of anxiety" when wearing something that doesn't fit people's expectations of you? Does that anxiety come from you, or from the "imaginary gender police" in the room? Why does society feel the need to monitor our wardrobes ?

### From "Insult" to "Identity": Words like "Tomboy" or "Gentleboy" have shifted in meaning over time. While "Tomboy" originally suggested a "rude boy," it has been reclaimed as a symbol of bold, sporty femininity .

  - In your social circle, is it "braver" for a girl to be masculine or a boy to be feminine? Do these labels feel like a "shield" that protects your identity, or a "fence" that keeps you in ?
  
## Closing Reflection

Gender expression is not a binary choice; it is a flowing spectrum. You don't have to shrink yourself to fit a script. Remember: your body is your canvas, and your expression is the first story you tell the world every single day.
