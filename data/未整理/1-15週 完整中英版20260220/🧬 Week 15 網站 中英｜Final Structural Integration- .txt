🧬 第一部分：中英對照版 (Bilingual Version)
🧬 Week 15 | Version A: Professional (Theory & Integration)
主題：從知識到責任——學期終章 (From Knowledge to Responsibility: The Final Chapter)
🎯 每週學習目標 (Weekly Learning Goals)
•	統整 這一學期的學習，並進行結構化的公開發表。
•	清晰表達 個人性別意識的成長與轉變。
•	評估 同儕設計的教育倡議計畫。
•	批判性反思 自己在知識、覺察與責任感上的轉化。
🧠 理論核心：解放的週期 (The Cycle of Liberation)
這門課並非線性的學習，而是一個持續擴張的循環：
•	覺察 (Awareness)： 學習看見日常生活中隱藏的性別模式。
•	反思 (Reflection)： 思考這些模式如何形塑我們的認同與選擇。
•	行動 (Action)： 透過桌遊設計或倡議，將想法轉化為實踐。
•	轉化 (Transformation)： 這種轉變最終將啟發他人並推動正義。
📚 全學期架構總複習 (15-Week Structural Review)
我們一起走過的這段旅程，其架構如下：
•	Week 1–4：概念建立與批判性思考（從命名、刻板印象到媒體分析）。
•	Week 5–9：認同、多樣性與結構（從性傾向、家庭到文化規範）。
•	Week 10–13：暴力、數位傷害與反思（從性騷擾到數位性別暴力）。
•	Week 14：教育倡議設計（掌握《不司險》桌遊引導）。
•	Week 15：整合、慶祝與責任感。
💡 討論與反思 (Let's Reflect Together)
•	我看見了什麼： 回顧這 15 週，哪一個主題讓你第一次感覺到「原來不平等藏在這種細節裡」？
•	引導者的倫理： 你選擇的 3 個倫理核心如何影響你帶領桌遊的方式？
•	未來的盟友： 離開這間教室後，你會如何在你的專業領域中繼續運用這種「結構性眼光」？
💬 學期結語：正義活現的模樣 (How Justice Lives)
「在這 15 週中，你已經從『學習單字』走向『建立覺察』，從『理解結構』走向『承擔責任』。你並非帶著與剛進教室時同樣的自己離開，現在的你擁有倫理意識、結構性思考與倡議能力。
你不需要改變全世界，但你可以改變：你說話的方式、你傾聽的方式、你介入的方式、你引導的方式，以及你與他人站在一起的方式。那就是正義活現的模樣」。

📚 關鍵字與反思範例 (Vocabulary & Review)
關鍵字 (Key Vocabulary)	專業反思範例 (Professional Reflection)
Synthesize (統整)	「我們統整了關於數位暴力與權力動力的學期所學」。
Structural Literacy (結構識讀)	「這門課提升了我的結構識讀力，讓我看見系統的影響」。

🗣️ TEEMI 口說練習：學期終章 (The Grand Finale)
為了準備最後一次與 TEEMI 的對話，請嘗試統整這 15 週的成長：
1.	"This course helped me synthesize core gender concepts into a real-world project."
2.	"I have developed structural awareness, which means I now see patterns instead of just single events."
3.	"I will continue my advocacy by promoting emotional safety and accountability."

🧬 第二部分：全英版 (Full English Version)
🧬 Week 12 | Version A: Professional English
Theme: Final Structural Integration: Reflection and Responsibility
🎯 Weekly Learning Goals
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
•	Synthesize their semester learning into a structured public presentation.
•	Articulate their personal gender awareness development clearly.
•	Evaluate peer-designed educational advocacy projects professionally.
•	Reflect critically on their transformation in knowledge, awareness, and responsibility.
🧠 Theoretical Core: The Cycle of Liberation
Our 15-week journey is not a line, but a cycle of growth:
•	Awareness: Spotting the gendered patterns hidden in daily life.
•	Reflection: Understanding how these patterns shape our identity and choices.
•	Action: Transforming reflection into advocacy through the "Ready for an Adventure" board game.
•	Transformation: A shift that inspires others and moves toward social justice.
📚 15-Week Structural Review (Comprehensive Review)
Let's review the architecture of what we have built together:
•	Week 1–4: Concepts & Critical Thinking (Naming, Stereotypes, Media analysis).
•	Week 5–9: Identity, Diversity & Structure (Orientation, Family, Cultural norms).
•	Week 10–13: Violence, Digital Harm & Reflection (Harassment, DGBV, Allyship).
•	Week 14: Advocacy & Educational Design (Mastering game facilitation).
•	Week 15: Integration, Celebration & Responsibility.
💡 Engaging Reflection Questions
•	The "Aha" Moment: Looking back, when did you first feel your "structural literacy" develop? How has that changed your worldview?
•	Ethics in Action: Which of the Digital Gender Ethics Cards did you rely on most during your facilitation practice?
•	Future Commitment: As you step out of this classroom, how will you use "structural thinking" in your future professional decisions?
💬 Closing: How Justice Lives
"In these 15 weeks, you have moved from vocabulary to awareness, from awareness to structure, and from structure to responsibility. You are not leaving this course as the same person who entered. You now carry ethical awareness, structural thinking, and advocacy skills.
You do not need to change the entire world. But you can change: how you speak, how you listen, how you intervene, how you facilitate, and how you stand with others. And that is how justice lives".
