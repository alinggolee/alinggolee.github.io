# Theme: From Parenting to Social Structure — Deconstructing the "Default Family" Script

## 🎯 Weekly Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, we will achieve the following:

- Analyze how gender norms influence parenting expectations.
- Explain how privilege operates within family structures.
- Evaluate how different family forms challenge traditional gender roles.
- Use academic English to discuss gender and parenting critically.
## 🧠 Theoretical Core: Parenting as Social Regulation

Parenting is often framed as a "private choice," but it is deeply regulated by social systems.

- Informal Laws: Social norms act as informal laws. Expectations about being a "good parent" or raising a "normal child" monitor and adjust our behavior more effectively than formal legislation.
- Institutional Practices: Privilege is built into institutions—from school enrollment forms to counseling systems—that often assume a heteronormative "default family".
💡 Engaging Discussion Questions

### The Silent Judgment:

Using the documentary Love Together (同愛一家) or Anima: My Father's Dress.

  - Humanized Question: Have you ever noticed the "look" strangers give when a parent doesn't fit the traditional image of a family? Where does that silent pressure come from? If you were in their shoes, would that pressure make you want to "hide," or would it inspire you to "redefine" what home means to you?
### The Vision for Change:

Using the 4-step framework (Describe → Analyze → Vision → Action).

  - Humanized Question: Think of a common "moral panic" regarding diverse families (e.g., "the child will be confused"). If we replace this fear with a vision of safety and support, what is one "small win" or action we can implement in our schools today?
## 💬 Closing Synthesis

"Parenting is a social practice. When diversity is treated as a problem, families carry the heavy burden of judgment. Our role is to shift the perspective from judgment to support, and from structure to action".
