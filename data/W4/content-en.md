# Week 4 ｜Media, gender and critical thinking

## How Norms are Maintained

Gender norms are not neutral; they are actively maintained through social and media mechanisms.

- Mechanisms of Regulation: Norms are kept in place through repetition, approval, ridicule, correction, and media amplification.
- The Goal of Media Literacy: It is not about "canceling" content, but about seeing the invisible structures. Once you see the structure, you gain agency over your choices.

## Discussion Questions

### The "Prince Charming" Code:

Why does media often cast men as the "saviors" and women as those waiting to be rescued? These narratives act like "social code" that regulates our expectations for love and life.

  - Think of a media moment that made you laugh or feel angry. If you remove the "ridicule" or the "judgment" from that scene, does the story still work? Why does society use humor or silence to "fix" people who don't fit in?
### Four-Step:

Using the framework of Describe → Analyze → Vision → Action, let's deconstruct a trending video.

  - When you see a controversial post online, is your first instinct to "join the crowd" or to "step back"? How does asking "Who holds the power here?" change the way you see the incident?
## Closing Reflection

Gender norms are maintained through repetition, social reaction, and silence. Media literacy is not a weapon for blame; it is a tool for vision. When we see the structure, we reclaim our power to decide who we want to be in the world.
