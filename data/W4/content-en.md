# Theme: Media Literacy, Gender, and Critical Thinking

## 🎯 Weekly Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize how gender norms and power operate in viral events and media narratives.
- Apply a four-step critical thinking framework (Describe → Analyze → Build Vision → Develop Action).
- Move from individual reaction to structural understanding of gender regulation in society.
## 🧠 Theoretical Core: How Norms are Maintained

Gender norms are not neutral; they are actively maintained through social and media mechanisms.

- Mechanisms of Regulation: Norms are kept in place through repetition, approval, ridicule, correction, and media amplification.
- The Goal of Media Literacy: It is not about "canceling" content, but about seeing the invisible structures. Once you see the structure, you gain agency over your choices.
💡 Engaging Discussion Questions

### The "Prince Charming" Code:

Why does media often cast men as the "saviors" and women as those waiting to be rescued? These narratives act like "social code" that regulates our expectations for love and life.

  - Humanized Question: Think of a media moment that made you laugh or feel angry. If you remove the "ridicule" or the "judgment" from that scene, does the story still work? Why does society use humor or silence to "fix" people who don't fit in?
### Your Four-Step Adventure:

Using the framework of Describe → Analyze → Vision → Action, let's deconstruct a trending video.

  - Humanized Question: When you see a controversial post online, is your first instinct to "join the crowd" or to "step back"? How does asking "Who holds the power here?" change the way you see the incident?
## 💬 Closing Synthesis

"Gender norms are maintained through repetition, social reaction, and silence. Media literacy is not a weapon for blame; it is a tool for vision. When we see the structure, we reclaim our power to decide who we want to be in the world".
