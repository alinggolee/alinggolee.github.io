Introduction to Gender & Socialization — From Stories to Structure

## Theoretical Core: The SOGIESC Map

To discuss diversity clearly and respectfully, we adopt the SOGIESC framework:
- **Sexual Orientation:** Who you are attracted to.
- **Gender Identity:** Your internal sense of being male, female, or another gender.
- **Gender Expression:** How you present yourself through behavior and appearance.
- **Sex Characteristics:** Physical traits like chromosomes and hormones.

> Vital Foundation: These four aspects are distinct and independent.

## Engaging Discussion Questions

### Invisible Lessons in Stories
Have you ever looked back at your favorite childhood book and realized it was trying to tell you who to be? If we always see boys as the heroes and girls as the ones needing rescue, how does that sneak into our minds as we grow up?

### The "Vibe" of Your Name
Does your name feel like a suit that fits you perfectly, or a label someone else chose? What kind of gendered expectations did your parents "tuck" into the syllables of your name?

## Closing Synthesis

"Gender messages begin quietly—through stories, colors, toys, and names. Week 1 is not about judgment; it is about seeing patterns. When we see patterns, we begin to see structure. And when we see structure, we can change it".
