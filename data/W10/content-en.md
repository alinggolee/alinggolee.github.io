# Week 10｜Sexual harassment

## Theoretical Core: Deconstructing the System of Harm

Sexual harassment is not a minor personal dispute; it is a boundary crossing within unequal systems.

- The Three-Part Frame: We analyze incidents through Physical Sensation (what happened?), Emotional Awareness (how did it feel?), and Power Structure (who holds authority?).
- Why It Persists: Harassment survives when power is unequal, social norms excuse the behavior (e.g., "just a joke"), and institutions remain silent.

## Engaging Discussion Questions

### The Choice in the Cup of Tea:

Using the classic video Tea Consent to understand enthusiastic consent.

  - Humanized Question: If someone forced you to drink tea you didn't want, you’d feel violated. But in real life, when your body gives you a "bad vibe" or a chill, do you ever try to talk yourself out of it? How can we learn to trust our inner voice again?

### Moving Beyond "Why Didn't You Say No?":

  - Humanized Question: Instead of asking a survivor why they didn't resist, what if we ask: "What was the power gap between these two people?" and "What kind of environment allowed this person to feel they could cross a boundary?" How does this shift change your understanding of justice?

## Closing: How Justice Lives

"Sexual harassment is not about misunderstanding. It is about boundaries crossing within unequal systems.

You do not need to change the entire world. But you can change: how you speak, how you listen, how you intervene, and how you stand with others. That is how justice lives".
