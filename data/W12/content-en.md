# Week 12｜Understanding Digital Gender-Based Violence

## How Systems Shape Harm

Digital harm is not just about "bad individuals"; it is about how our digital environment is built.

- Digital platforms want to keep you scrolling. Their algorithms often prioritize "engagement," which means provocative or harmful gendered messages often get the most views.
- Digital violence does not affect everyone equally. It has a disproportionate impact on marginalized identities, reflecting existing power imbalances in our society.

## EDiscussion Questions

### The Digital Mirror: Have you noticed how your "For You" page or feed influences your ideas about gender roles?

### Platform Accountability: Who is more responsible for online safety: the user who needs to be careful, or the platform that hosts the content?

### Structural Change: Instead of just teaching victims to "block and report," how can we demand a structural reform of the digital systems themselves?

## Closing Reflection

Digital gender-based violence is a systemic issue. To stop it, we must move from individual reactions to structural transformation. Prevention is not just about being safe; it’s about changing the digital architecture.
