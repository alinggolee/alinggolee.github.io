# Theme: Advocacy & Educational Design: Facilitating "Ready for an Adventure!"

## 🎯 Weekly Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

### Identify and apply professional ethics in gender education facilitation.

### Analyze and interpret board game mechanics as specific representations of digital gender-based violence.

### Design and evaluate reflective questions and assessment tools for community-based teaching.

## 🧠 Theoretical Core: Ethical Facilitation and Structural Awareness

Facilitation is more than just playing; it is an act of advocacy. We use the Digital Gender Ethics Cards as our professional guide:

- Do No Harm: Prioritizing the emotional safety of participants over finishing the game.
- Center Structural Awareness: Shifting the focus from individual "mistakes" to institutional and algorithmic responsibility.
- Promote Accountability: Clearly identifying who is responsible for digital harm in the game scenarios.
🎲 Board Game Application: Mechanics to Meaning

Master the mechanics of "Ready for an Adventure!" to facilitate deeper learning:

- Crisis Cards: These represent "Risk Escalation" in digital spaces (e.g., non-consensual sharing).
- Strategy Cards: Actions like "Save Evidence" and "SIARC Support" illustrate proactive preventive strategies.
- Gems (Knowledge, Friendship, Love): These represent the resources needed to navigate a crisis successfully.
💡 Engaging Discussion Questions

- The Ethical Shift: If a player starts victim-blaming during the game, how will you use the Digital Gender Ethics Cards to redirect the conversation toward structural accountability?
- Mechanic Reflection: Why does the "Seek Peer Support" card provide a safety gem? What does this teach students about relational safety?
- Reflective Debriefing: What is one question you can ask at the end of the game to ensure students understand that digital harm is a systemic issue, not just a personal one?
## 💬 Closing Synthesis

"Facilitation is not just about explaining rules; it is about carrying an ethical position. When you facilitate this game, you are advocating for a safer, more just digital world".
