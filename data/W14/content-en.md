# Week 14｜Advocacy & Educational Design: Ready for an Adventure (Community Outreach Version)

##  Ethical Facilitation and Structural Awareness

Facilitation is more than just playing; it is an act of advocacy. We use the Digital Gender Ethics Cards as our professional guide:

- Do No Harm: Prioritizing the emotional safety of participants over finishing the game.
- Center Structural Awareness: Shifting the focus from individual "mistakes" to institutional and algorithmic responsibility.
- Promote Accountability: Clearly identifying who is responsible for digital harm in the game scenarios.

Board Game Application: Mechanics to Meaning

Master the mechanics of "Ready for an Adventure!" to facilitate deeper learning:

- Crisis Cards: These represent "Risk Escalation" in digital spaces (e.g., non-consensual sharing).
- Strategy Cards: Actions like "Save Evidence" and "SIARC Support" illustrate proactive preventive strategies.
- Gems (Knowledge, Friendship, Love): These represent the resources needed to navigate a crisis successfully.

## Discussion Questions

- The Ethical Shift: If a player starts victim-blaming during the game, how will you use the Digital Gender Ethics Cards to redirect the conversation toward structural accountability?
- Mechanic Reflection: Why does the "Seek Peer Support" card provide a safety gem? What does this teach students about relational safety?
- Reflective Debriefing: What is one question you can ask at the end of the game to ensure students understand that digital harm is a systemic issue, not just a personal one?

## Closing Refelction

Facilitation is not just about explaining rules; it is about carrying an ethical position. When you facilitate this game, you are advocating for a safer, more just digital world.



## Game Setup (遊戲準備說明)
Arrange Strategy Cards Face-up (策略卡圖面朝上排列)
Place Draw Deck (放置牌庫)
Player (玩家)
Shelter (庇護所)
Unused Crisis Cards (未入牌庫的危機卡)
Gem Supply (寶石庫)

Round 1: Game Setup Card
From the 10 Crisis types, select 4 to add to the deck for this round.
Add 1 “Lost in the Net” Card.
Shuffle the above with Gem Cards and one set of Artifact Cards to form the Round 1 Draw Deck.
Place the Help Strategy Cards (7 types) in separate face-up stacks to the side.
Rule: At the end of each round, players can spend Gems to purchase Help Strategy Cards.

Round 2: Game Setup Card
From the 6 Crisis types not selected in Round 1, select 4 to add to the deck for this round.
Add 1 “Lost in the Net” Card.
Shuffle these with Gem Cards and one set of Artifact Cards to form the Round 2 Draw Deck.
The remaining setup and gameplay are the same as Round 1 (The 7 types of Help Strategy Cards remain face-up available for purchase).
Rule: At the end of each round, players can spend Gems to purchase Help Strategy Cards.

Round 3: Game Setup Card
First, add the 2 remaining Crisis types.
Then, randomly add 2 more Crisis types (Recommendation: Randomly select 2 from the 8 types used in previous rounds; or to avoid repetition, you may instead choose from the types unused in Round 2).
Add 1 “Lost in the Net” Card.
Shuffle these with Gem Cards and one set of Artifact Cards to form the Round 3 Draw Deck.
The remaining setup and gameplay are the same as previous rounds.


Game Flow & Rules Cards
Step 1: “Ready for an Adventure? GO~”
Each player places their Pawn (human-shaped token) in one of their palms and closes both hands into fists to prepare for the game.
Players chant together: “Ready for an Adventure? GO~”, then simultaneously reveal their palms.
Resolution:
Empty Palm à Decided to Go Offline
The player decides to leave the round. They may share the “Gems collected on the return journey” alone or with other partners who also chose to go Offline.
Palm with Pawn à Decided to Go Online
The player decides to stay. They continue into the next turn of the adventure.
Step 2: “Crisis or Gem”
The players participating in the adventure collectively reveal the top card of the deck:
(A) If a Crisis Card is revealed:
If the same Crisis appears for the third time à The round ends immediately. All players who have not returned to the Shelter lose all Gems accumulated in this round.
If players possess a Help Strategy Card, they can eliminate the third identical Crisis. In the next turn, they can choose: to continue exploring or to retreat safely to the Shelter.


Game Flow & Rules Cards
(B) If a Gem Card is revealed: 
Distribute the Gem quantity equally among all players currently remaining in the adventure. If there is a remainder, place the leftover Gems on the card to be potentially collected later.
(C) If an Artifact Card is revealed: 
Place the Artifact Card on the path. It can only be claimed directly by a player who returns to the Shelter alone. If multiple players return simultaneously, an auction is held: the winner of the auction receives the Artifact Card. The Artifact Card can be used in future rounds to cancel two Crises; if unused, it counts towards the final score.
Step 3: “Time to Seek Help?”
At the end of each round, players may freely decide whether to purchase a Help Strategy Card. If the supply of cards is insufficient, players determine the recipient through a bidding auction.
