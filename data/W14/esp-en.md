## ESP Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

Students will be able to:

- Use target vocabulary (e.g., Facilitation, Structural Awareness, Intersectionality) accurately.

- Advocacy (n.): Public support for a cause or policy.
  - Ex: "Using this game in schools is a form of digital gender-justice advocacy."
