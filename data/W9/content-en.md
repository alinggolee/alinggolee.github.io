# Week 9 ｜Tradition, Change, and Gendered Identity

## The Dynamic Balance of Agency

Social rules can sometimes feel like a "cage" (牢籠); however, when rules fade, people may experience a loss of standards. Today, we explore the "dynamic balance" between individuals and systems.

- Living Traditions: Tradition is not a static relic. It is a living standard that we can "reinterpret" to fit modern values. We are not just managed by structure; we help it evolve.
- Formation of Identity: The Truku identity shifted from scattered clan definitions to a unified group consciousness due to environmental changes and relocation.

## 15-Week Structural Review (Comprehensive Review)

Let's review the architecture of what we have built together:

- Week 1–4: Concepts & Critical Thinking (Naming, Stereotypes, Media analysis).
- Week 5–9: Identity, Diversity & Structure (Orientation, Family, and today's Cultural Change).
- Week 10–13: Violence, Digital Harm & Reflection (Harassment, DGBV, Allyship).
- Week 14: Advocacy & Educational Design (Mastering game facilitation).
- Week 15: Integration, Celebration & Responsibility.

## Discussion Questions

### Finding Freedom in a Glass of Wine:

In Truku tradition, a young man who loves a woman might use a "strategy" by offering alcohol to her father until he is "intoxicated"—a sign of gaining his blessing.

  - Do you think this man is "breaking the rules" or "playing the rules"? Have you ever found a clever, loving way to navigate a strict family rule while still being true to yourself?

### The Fading Voice of the Leader:

Traditional leaders (Bukun) once managed harmony and external relations. However, modern administrative systems have shifted this authority.

  - Think about the elders in your family. When their "authority" shifts because the world has changed, does that make you feel liberated, or a little sad for the loss of tradition? How can we find our own voice while still respecting our roots?
## Closing: How Justice Lives

In these 15 weeks, we have moved from vocabulary to awareness, from awareness to structure, and from structure to responsibility. We are not leaving this course as the same person who entered. You now carry ethical awareness, structural thinking, and advocacy skills.
