# Theme: Diversity and Structural Inequality — From Cultural Code to Structural Legitimacy

## 🎯 Weekly Learning Goals

By the end of this session, we will achieve the following:

- Explain how Gaya functions as a comprehensive gender norm system.
- Analyze how cultural rules regulate gender roles through the distribution of legitimacy and authority.
- Compare Gaya with family-based gender norms using structural theory.
- Apply intersectional thinking to analyze cultural gender systems.
## 🧠 Theoretical Core: Gaya as a Regulatory Framework

This week, we move from "viewing interesting cultures" to "performing structural analysis."

- Norms and Power: According to Chapter 8, norms are informal rules reinforced by social expectations. When these norms become sacred or "Gaya," they become structural. When they are enforced by a group, they transform into power.
- The Formation of Roles: The traditional requirement that "men must hunt and women must weave" illustrates how gender norm clustering leads to fixed roles (Norm → Role → Expectation → Regulation).
💡 Engaging Discussion Questions

### The Ancestors are Watching (The Invisible CCTV):

Gaya is often framed as ancestral protection, but it can also feel like a "frightening web of social control".

  - Humanized Question: Imagine if every single choice you made—what you wore today or who you shared a meal with—was being watched by the "eyes of the ancestors." Does that feel like a warm hug or a heavy surveillance camera? Does your own culture have an "invisible Gaya" that guides your gender expression?
### Who Defines Morality? (The Privilege of Judgment):

Privilege includes the authority to define norms and the right to judge.

  - Humanized Question: In your community or family, who gets to decide what is "sacred" or "shameful"? Why are some voices automatically believed while others are silenced? Is this authority earned, or is it a byproduct of structural privilege?
## 💬 Closing Synthesis

"Gaya is not just tradition; it is a regulatory system. Every society has its Gaya—some are written, some are religious, and some are invisible. When we analyze Truku culture, we are learning to see our own structure. Because when we remove the word 'Gaya,' what remains are family rules, gender expectations, and privilege distribution. Week 8 teaches us: Structure is everywhere".
