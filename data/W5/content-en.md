# Week 5 ｜Sexual Orientation

## Beyond Identity Labels

In academic discourse, sexual orientation is more than just a label; it is a complex social construct.

- The Split Attraction Model (SAM): This framework allows us to differentiate between "romantic" and "sexual" pulls. One can be aromantic but sexual, or biromantic but asexual.
- Heteronormativity: The social belief that heterosexuality is the default or "normal" state. This often leads to the erasure or marginalization of non-straight identities.
- Conceptual Clarity: It is vital to remember that who you are (identity) and who you love (orientation) are distinct and independent variables.

## Discussion Questions

### The Landscape of Desire: "Looking For?": Using the documentary Looking For? by Chou Tung-yen, we explore the digital landscape of modern attraction.

  - When you are scrolling through a dating app, are you looking for a "label" or a "human connection"? If we removed all the bio tags like "straight" or "gay," how would you describe the feeling of being "drawn" to someone? Is that feeling purely yours, or is it guided by what society calls an "ideal type"?
### Unlabeled Youth: Exploring the song YOUTH by Troye Sivan, which celebrates the freedom of self-discovery.

  - Have you ever felt that society is in a hurry to "categorize" your feelings? If we chose to remain "unlabeled" for a while, would that feel like a scary lack of direction, or like a total, beautiful freedom?
  
## Closing Reflection

Sexual orientation is not merely a personal preference; it is socially interpreted, regulated, and politicized. Understanding attraction academically allows us to reduce harm and erasure. Desire exists within society; to understand desire, we must first understand power.
