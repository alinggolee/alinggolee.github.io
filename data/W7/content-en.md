# Week 7 ｜GBP, Trans Experience and Privilege

## Mapping Power and Identity

Gender is more than a personal feeling; it is an active system of authority.

- Individual Level: Internal identity and self-perception.
- Interactional Level: How others respond to you, including "gender policing" or unearned respect.
- Structural Level: How institutions distribute authority and credibility. Who is automatically seen as "competent"?

## Discussion Questions

### When the Room Goes Quiet:

Using Paula Stone Williams' TED Talk: I’ve lived as a man and as a woman — here’s what I’ve learned.

  - Imagine walking into a meeting with the same expertise you have now, but suddenly, no one takes you seriously because of your "gender presentation." How would that loss of "unearned authority" affect your confidence and your career?
### The "Invisible Default":

Discussing Cisnormativity and how society assumes certain identities are the "norm".

  - Privilege isn't about not working hard; it’s about not having to face extra "gendered hurdles" in your daily life. Have you noticed how some people can just "be themselves" in public while others have to constantly navigate social expectations?
## Closing Reflection

Gender norms are not always loud; they are routine. Privilege is not announced; it is assumed. Hierarchy is not always violent; it is often procedural. When someone transitions, the procedure changes and the structure becomes visible. Gender education is not about blame; it is about structural literacy—the foundation of social transformation.
