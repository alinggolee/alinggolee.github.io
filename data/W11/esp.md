## Academic Vocabulary & Conceptual Practice

To discuss body politics professionally, master these key terms:

Key Term	Simple Definition	Practical Example

Aesthetic Hierarchy	A social ranking system for beauty.	"The media maintains an aesthetic hierarchy by only featuring thin models."

Body Surveillance	Constantly monitoring one's own body.	"Social media encourages body surveillance through filters and likes."

Commodification	Turning something (like a body) into a product.	"The commodification of beauty creates massive profit for the diet industry."

Internalized Discipline	Self-correcting to follow social rules.	"Wearing makeup can be a form of internalized discipline to meet gender norms."

Discourse Scaffolding: Analyzing Media

Use these B1-B2 sentence frames to build your arguments:

- "This advertisement illustrates how beauty standards function as a form of gender regulation."
- "From a structural perspective, this commercial benefits the industry at the expense of consumer self-esteem."
- "This phenomenon suggests that body surveillance has become a routine part of daily life."
