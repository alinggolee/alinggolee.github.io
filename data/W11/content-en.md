# Week 11｜Body & Beauty Standards

## Theoretical Core: The Shift from Regulation to Discipline

While harassment represents a visible use of power, body discipline operates through invisible power. In this stage of socialization, gender norms move from external enforcement to internalization.

- The Body as a Regulated Site: Gender policing extends to the physical body, regulating size, posture, muscle, and even skin .

- Gendered Discipline: Under the aesthetic hierarchy, women are often told to shrink (be thin and soft), while men are told to expand (be tall and muscular). Both groups are controlled, but in different ways.

- Commodification of Insecurity: Insecurity is profitable. Industries such as beauty products, cosmetic surgery, and fitness supplements benefit when people feel their natural bodies are "not enough" .

## Engaging Themes & Critical Discussions

We will explore these concepts through diverse media narratives:

- The #LikeAGirl Campaign: How language shapes self-regulation and identity .
- Ashley Graham’s Body Positivity: Analyzing if empowerment is sometimes used as a branding tool .
- Media Malice (The Titanic Case): Discussing how the media attacked Kate Winslet’s weight, reinforcing the idea that women must be thin to be "worthy" .
- The Mask You Live In: Exploring the emotional cost of "Hegemonic Masculinity" and the pressure on men to suppress vulnerability .

## Deep Inquiry Questions:

- The "Invisible Cage": How much time do we spend daily monitoring our appearance to meet social expectations?

- The Profit of Shame: Who benefits financially when you feel unhappy with a specific part of your body?

- Self-Surveillance: In the age of social media and filters, how do we become both the "watcher" and the "watched"?

### Resisting the Norm: Can we imagine a media representation that values health and diversity over a strict aesthetic hierarchy?

## Teacher’s Closing Script

"Harassment uses force; beauty uses mirrors . While harassment silences through fear, beauty standards silence through constant comparison . Power is not always loud. Sometimes it whispers: 'You are not enough' . When we recognize that whisper, we reclaim our agency".
