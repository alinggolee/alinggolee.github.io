# Week 13｜Digital Gender-Based Violence: Critical Reflection

## The Body-Emotion-Power Triangle

We decompose digital harm using three analytical lenses:

- Body: How the body becomes a site of control through digital exposure .
- Emotion: How shame and fear are used as leverage to manipulate victims .
- Power: How unequal social structures turn trust into control .

## Feature Case: The 2025 Privacy Violation Story

Summary: A female student sent a nude photo to a male student she trusted from a dating app. After a conflict, he shared her private images along with her personal identity online as a form of revenge .

## Discussion Questions

- Beyond "Don'ts": The "Five Don'ts and Four Do's" are important, but why are they insufficient for university-level awareness?

- Critiquing Trust: Is the statement "she sent it because she trusted him" too simple? How do power and fear operate in this interaction?
- The Silent Majority: If you saw this incident online, what would prevent you from acting? How does bystander silence maintain a harmful system?
- Reverse Scenarios: Would the social judgment or public reaction change if the genders were reversed?

## Closing Reflection

Prevention is not only about avoiding risk. It is about building collective knowledge, responsibility, and care. We must move from individual rules to structural transformation.
