# Week 2 ｜Gender Concepts & Naming

## Naming as Gendered Politics

Names are not just sounds; they are part of gender politics.

- Bi Heng-Da (2007) argues that naming is "gendered naming." Parents project expectations onto children before they can choose for themselves.
- Names structure social perception and can influence evaluations in contexts like hiring.


## Discussion Questions

### Is Your Name a Cage or a Suit? In English-speaking cultures, names like "Grace" imply elegance, while "Edward" means "guardian of wealth". Similar patterns exist in Taiwan, where names are often "soft" for girls and "strong" for boys .

  - Close your eyes and say your name. Does it feel like a "perfectly tailored suit" that helps you move, or a "tight label" that holds you back? If you swapped names with someone of a different gender today, how would the world treat you differently ?

  - Does your name feel like a suit that fits you perfectly, or a label someone else chose? What kind of gendered expectations did your parents "tuck" into the syllables of your name?

### Indigenous names in Taiwan often reflect connection to land, ancestry, or social class rather than just biological traits . For example, Paiwan names honor family honor and land connection.

  - When a culture's naming system is erased, do the "gender roles" within that culture change too? Is your name a "family resume" or a "personal introduction"?

## Closing Reflection

Names are not destiny. But they are social signals. Signals create expectations. Expectations shape opportunity. Next week, we will ask: How do we 'perform' those expectations in our daily lives?
