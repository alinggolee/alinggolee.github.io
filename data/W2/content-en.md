## 🎯 Weekly Learning Goals

- Build confidence in using academic English for gender-related discussions.
## 🧠 Theoretical Core: Naming as Gendered Politics

Names are not just sounds; they are part of gender politics.

- The Social Script: Bi Heng-Da (2007) argues that naming is "gendered naming." Parents project expectations onto children before they can choose for themselves.
- Social Signals: Names structure social perception and can influence evaluations in contexts like hiring.

💡 Engaging Discussion Questions

### Is Your Name a Cage or a Suit? In English-speaking cultures, names like "Grace" imply elegance, while "Edward" means "guardian of wealth". Similar patterns exist in Taiwan, where names are often "soft" for girls and "strong" for boys .

  - Humanized Question: Close your eyes and say your name. Does it feel like a "perfectly tailored suit" that helps you move, or a "tight label" that holds you back? If you swapped names with someone of a different gender today, how would the world treat you differently ?
### The Battle for Indigenous Identity: Indigenous names in Taiwan often reflect connection to land, ancestry, or social class rather than just biological traits . For example, Paiwan names honor family honor and land connection.

  - Humanized Question: When a culture's naming system is erased, do the "gender roles" within that culture change too? Is your name a "family resume" or a "personal introduction"?
## 💬 Closing Synthesis

"Names are not destiny. But they are social signals. Signals create expectations. Expectations shape opportunity. Next week, we will ask: How do we 'perform' those expectations in our daily lives?"
